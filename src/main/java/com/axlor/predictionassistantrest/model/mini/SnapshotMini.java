/*
    This class represents a Snapshot and how to find in using this application's REST API.
    When a user makes a GET request to "../snapshots", we want to show them a list of all snapshots and where to find a specific one.
    However, getting every Snapshot from the database is extremely expensive and we'd be showing/retrieving a bunch of data they don't need (probably).

    The "../snapshots" mapping will return a JSON representation of a list of these objects. The user then has Time/Date of a snapshot, its unique ID, and a link to that Snapshot's data.
